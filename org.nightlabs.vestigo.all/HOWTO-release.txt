1) Check-out *all* projects in trunk: https://dev.nightlabs.org/svn/private/main/vestigo/trunk/

2) Determine the old and the new version number. Look in a "pom.xml" to see the old version number. For
this example, we assume, our old version is "0.7.0-SNAPSHOT" and our new version is "0.7.0".

2) Replace "<version>0.7.0-SNAPSHOT</version>" by "<version>0.7.0</version>" in ALL "pom.xml" files.

Make sure, there is only exactly one line modified in every "pom.xml"! You can easily see this using the
"Preview" feature of Eclipse's replace dialog.

3) Open the class 'VersionUpdater' in 'org.nightlabs.vestigo.release' and set its field 'newMavenVersion' to
"0.7.0". Save the file and run its main method.

4) Run "mvn clean install" in "org.nightlabs.vestigo.all".

5) Refresh all projects in Eclipse and wait for the build to finish. You might need to right-click => Maven
=> "Update Project Configuration..." on some projects, if they still have error markers.

6) Check-in and wait for Jenkins to build all. Manually trigger the deployment of the stand-alone assemblies
after the main build.

7) Create a tag in svn.

8) Repeat all (except for the tag) for the next SNAPSHOT version, i.e to switch from "0.7.0" to "0.7.1-SNAPSHOT".
SVN trunk should always be in SNAPSHOT mode and only temporarily have a release version.
