To setup a workspace (with target-platform) do  

mvn clean install 

in the following projects

org.nightlabs.vestigo.all
org.nightlabs.vestigo.tycho

On linux you can use the following script from your workspace root.
Note that this will also execute the tests.

mvn clean install -f org.nightlabs.vestigo.all/pom.xml ; if [[ $? != 0 ]] ; then exit $? ; fi ; mvn clean install -f org.nightlabs.vestigo.tycho/pom.xml

This leaves you with a target-platform you can use under

org.nightlabs.vestigo.tycho/product/dev/target/products/org.nightlabs.vestigo.ui.product.dev/{your-os}/{your-ws}/{your-arch}
