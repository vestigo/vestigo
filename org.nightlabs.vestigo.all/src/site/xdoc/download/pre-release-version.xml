		<h2>Vestigo pre-release version</h2>
		<div class="section">
			<p>
				The currently distributed version of Vestigo targets early adopters as some aspects of the 
				software and documentation are subject to frequent change over the next couple of weeks.
				The areas where Vestigo is still improved are listed on this site. 
			</p>

			<h3>UI and behaviour of the standalone application</h3>
				<div class="section">
					<p>
						The standalone version of Vestigo is based on the Eclipse-IDE and currently it is not yet 
						stripped down to include only the functionality of Vestigo. This means that the not only
						the download of the standalone version is very large, but also that you will get a complete
						Eclipse-IDE instead of only the JDO/JPA browser.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally the standalone version needs to behave a little different than the Eclipse plug-in.
						For example the standalone-version should be able to manage queries directly in the 
						file-system while the Eclipse plug-in restricts the query management to the Eclipse workspace.
					</p>
				</div>
			<h3>Documentation on this website</h3>
				<div class="section">
					<p>
						There is still some documentation missing on the website that helps users to use Vestigo.
