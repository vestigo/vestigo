How to create a JPA query

	In this guide, we'll show you how to create a JPA query. We'll start with a very basic one and then add
	more and more complexity exploring the possibilities of Vestigo and JPQL.

* Prepare the data source

	First, you need to create a {{{../data-source.html}data source}}. In order to do that, you can follow
	one of these guides:

	* {{{../jpa/quick-start.html}Quick start}} (note that you'll have to create a <<JPA>> data source - not JDO - but
	the process is nearly the same)

	* {{{./how-to-set-up-a-jpa-data-source.html}How to set up a JPA data source}}

	[]

	In the following, we'll assume you used the <Quick start> and therefore make use of the data model provided
	by our demo data.

* Open a query editor

	There are multiple ways to open a query editor:

** Open an anonymous query (without file)

	You can open a query editor without a file (you can still save the contents of the editor to a file, later, if you like).
	In the <Data Source Explorer> view, select the data source you want to query and right-click on it to open the context-menu.
	In the context-menu, choose <Open JDO/JPA query editor>. Alternatively you can click the appropriate action in the
	view's action-bar.

** Create a project and a query file

	Open the <Project Explorer> view and right-click anywhere in the white area. In the occuring context-menu,
	choose: <New> => <Project...>
	
[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/015.png]

	This will open the <New Project> wizard, in which you can select <Vestigo project> and click <Next>.

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/020.png]

	The second wizard page asks you for a project name. After you specified it, you can click <Finish>. There's
	no need to change anything else on this wizard page.

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/025.png]

	After you created the project, right-click on it to create a new <JDO/JPA query file>.

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/030.png]

	You have to select the data source (aka connection profile) you want to use and then click <Next>.

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/035.png]

	Give the file a name and click <Finish>. Note, that you do not have to specify the file extension.
	It is automatically added.

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/040.png]

** Open an anonymous query via the <Candidate classes> view

	If you followed the {{{./quick-start.html}quick start guide}}, you already know this way and there's no need to
	demonstrate it here again.

* Write a simple query

	The first thing you should do, is pressing [Ctrl]+[Space] which will trigger the <Code assist> feature.
	You'll see a list of (key) words and characters that you can enter at the current location.   

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/045.png]

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/046.png]

	After <<<SELECT>>>, you'll have to manually enter space + "m" + space, but then, you can continue pressing [Ctrl]+[Space] again.
	We keep things simple and choose <<<FROM>>>.

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/047.png]

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/050.png]

	When you hit [Ctrl]+[Space] after <<<SELECT m FROM>>> and the connection to the data source is currently not open,
	Vestigo will ask you, if you want to open it. Press <<<Yes>>> to continue and get a list of available candidate
	classes.

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/055.png]

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/060.png]

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/061.png]

	Once you specified the candidate class with its alias "m", your query is complete enough to be executed.
	Press [Ctrl]+[F5] or click the corresponding button!

* Add some simple criteria

	Now it's time to constrain our query. After all, you normally don't want all objects of a certain type. So we add a
	<<<WHERE>>> clause with a criterion on the field <<<Movie.name>>>: We only want movies with a name containing the
	string "am".

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/065.png]

* Use a query parameter

	It is good practice to use query parameters instead of writing the criteria inline. In an application, the most
	important reasons for this are:

	*

	Security: The use of query parameters renders attacks like {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection}SQL injection}}
	impossible. Even though, we're dealing with JPAQL (and not SQL) here, pasting user-input directly into the JPAQL might
	still lead to a vulnerability comparable to the well-known SQL injection.

	*

	Performance: Queries can be precompiled and executed with varying query parameter values. That's faster than
	compiling the query again and again.

	*

	Robustness: With query parameters, you don't have to care about correct escaping. Technically, this is the same as
	the aspect of security mentioned above, but from a different point of view (whether the query works or fails).

	[]

	Of course, these reasons do not matter, if you write a query in Vestigo. But they start to matter, when you copy
	the query from Vestigo into an application or the other way around.

	There are more reasons for query parameters, but rather than iterating them here, we better demonstrate
	how you can use query parameters in Vestigo: Focus the <Query parameters> view and click the <Add> button.

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/070.png]

	A new line will appear and you can give the parameter a name and a value. The type <<<java.lang.String>>> is already
	fine for our situation. In other cases, you might want to select another type, though.

	Note, that Vestigo supports JavaScript query parameters, which is explained in detail in
	{{{../how-to-declare-a-query-parameter-using-javascript.html}How to declare a query parameter using JavaScript}}.

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/075.png]

	Back in the query editor, you can replace the <<<"am">>> by a colon and press [Ctrl]+[Space]: Code-assist will show you
	all available query parameters. Of course, so far, there's only one.

[../../images/jpa/how-to-create-a-jpa-query/080.png]

	Confirm the parameter using [Enter] and your query is ready to be executed again. Note, that the error marker (which already
	turned gray when you completed the query) completely disappears when you save the query (e.g. using [Ctrl]+S or via <File> => <Save>).

* More JPQL

	The JPA Query Language is very powerful and it is far beyond the scope of this document to explain the entire language. We
	recommend you take a look at the following pages to learn more about JPQL:

	* {{{http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_3_0/jpa/jpql.html}DataNucleus: JPA : JPQL SELECT Queries}}

	* {{{http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_3_0/jpa/jpql_functions.html}DataNucleus: JPA: JPQL Functions}}

	* {{{http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_3_0/jpa/jpql_subquery.html}DataNucleus: JPA: JPQL Subqueries}}
