JPA EntityManagerFactory

	Any JPA-enabled application will require at least one <EntityManagerFactory>. Typically applications
	create one per datastore being utilised. An <EntityManagerFactory> provides access to <EntityManager>s
	which allow objects to be persisted, and retrieved.

	Please read more on the {{{http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_3_0/jpa/emf.html}DataNucleus web site}}.
