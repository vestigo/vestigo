I found the contents of this 'bsh' package here:

http://www.dirisala.net/scripting/

It is released under LGPL.

Additionally to the sources in this 'bsh' package, there is the registration in
${basedir}/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory
belonging to this code.

Unfortunately, there seems to be no Maven artefact - hence I included it directly
here, for now. We might create a separate project, later (if nobody else does - e.g.
the BeanShell team).

Note: I modified BeanShellBindings! I switched from strictJava = true to strictJava = false.
